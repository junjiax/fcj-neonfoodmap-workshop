# NeonFoodMap - Deploying a Cloud-Native Application on AWS

#### Overview

This workshop guides you through the entire process of building, developing, and operating **NeonFoodMap**—a food and travel map application—on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The project employs modern Cloud & DevOps models, featuring a fully automated CI/CD pipeline, Multi-AZ readiness, and a comprehensive monitoring system.

The workshop is divided into key stages:

- **Infrastructure**: Setting up the network and AWS service foundation (VPC, RDS, S3, IAM)
- **Deployment**: Building a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and deploying the application to ECS Fargate
- **Operations**: Configuring auto-scaling, CDN distribution, monitoring, cost alerts, and end-to-end testing
- **Illustrations**: Reference list of all screenshots used in the workshop

#### Architecture Overview

The system is organized into the following main layers:

| Layer | Components |
|-------|------------|
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions, OIDC, AWS STS, Amazon ECR |
| Presentation | Amazon CloudFront, Amazon S3 (Frontend) |
| Application | Application Load Balancer, Amazon ECS Fargate |
