### 5.5.6. End-to-End Testing

After completing this section, the system will be verified to ensure:
- The complete user flow from **Frontend** through **ALB** to **Backend (ECS)** works correctly
- Storage and CDN services (**S3, CloudFront, RDS MySQL**) serve data as expected
- No errors, broken links, or data issues exist in core features
