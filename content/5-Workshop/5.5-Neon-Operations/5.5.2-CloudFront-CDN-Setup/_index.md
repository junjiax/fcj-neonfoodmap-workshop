### 5.5.2. CloudFront + CDN Setup

### Create a CloudFront Distribution

Open the CloudFront console, go to **Distributions**, and select **Create distribution**. Then configure the following settings:

**Distribution name:** Enter `neonfoodmap-frontend-cdn`.

**Description – optional:** Leave this blank or enter `CloudFront CDN for NeonFoodmap Frontend and API`.

**Distribution type:** Keep **Single website or app** selected.

**Domain (Route 53 managed domain – optional):** Leave this blank because the project uses the default `*.cloudfront.net` URL provided by AWS.

### Configure the S3 Origin and OAC

**Origin type:** Select **Amazon S3**.

**S3 origin:** Select the `neonfoodmap-frontend-dev.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com` bucket.

**Origin path – optional:** Leave this blank; do not enter `/path`, because the frontend is stored in the bucket root.

**Allow private S3 bucket access to CloudFront:** Keep **Allow private S3 bucket access to CloudFront – Recommended** selected. This enables **Origin Access Control (OAC)**, allowing CloudFront to read the private bucket while preventing direct user access to S3.

**Origin settings:** Keep **Use recommended origin settings**.

**Cache settings:** Keep **Use recommended cache settings tailored to serving S3 content**.

### Adjust the ALB Origin

After creating the distribution, open **Distributions**, select the newly created distribution, open the **Origins** tab, and edit the linked Elastic Load Balancing origin. Set *Protocol* to **HTTP only** to match the current ALB/API configuration and avoid communication issues or `400 Bad Request` responses caused by a protocol mismatch.

Wait until the distribution status is **Enabled** and deployment is complete, then open the deployed URL.
