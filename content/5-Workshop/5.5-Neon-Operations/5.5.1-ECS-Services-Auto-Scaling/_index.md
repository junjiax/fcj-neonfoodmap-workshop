### 5.5.1. ECS Services + Auto-Scaling

### Create the Backend Service

1. Open **ECS → Clusters → NeonFoodmap-cluster → Create service**.
2. Select the `neonfoodmap-task-be` task definition family, set the service name to `svc-neonfoodmap-be`, and select the latest **Task definition revision**.

3. In the networking section, select the application VPC, its **private subnets**, and the ECS task security group.

4. Under **Load balancing**, select the `ALB-NeonFoodMap` **Application Load Balancer**, the existing `80:HTTP` listener, container port `8000`, and the existing `TG-NeonFoodMap-BE` target group.

5. Review the configuration and select **Create**. ECS creates the task, registers its IP address with the target group, and registers it with Cloud Map.

### Create the Frontend Service

Repeat the service-creation process for the frontend: select the `neonfoodmap-task-fe` task definition, set the service name to `svc-neonfoodmap-fe`, and choose the private subnets and ECS task security group. Under **Load balancing**, select `ALB-NeonFoodMap`, the `80:HTTP` listener, container port `8000`, and the `TG-NeonFoodMap-BE` target group.

After creation, ECS performs a rolling deployment. During this time, keep enough tasks in the `Healthy` state so the ALB does not route requests to tasks that are not ready.

### Enable Auto Scaling and Create a CPU Policy

1. Open the `svc-neonfoodmap-be` service, go to the **Service auto scaling** tab, and select **Update**.
2. Enable **Use service auto scaling**. Under *Capacity limits*, set the minimum number of tasks to `2` and the maximum to `6`. This keeps two backend tasks ready to serve requests while limiting scale-out to six tasks to control costs.

3. In the scaling policy section, choose **Target tracking**. Name the policy `cpu-70-target-tracking` and select the **ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization** metric. This metric measures the average CPU usage across all running tasks in the service.
4. Set the *Target value* to `70`. When average CPU usage exceeds 70%, ECS Service Auto Scaling adds tasks to distribute the load. When CPU usage falls, ECS can remove tasks but never below the minimum of two.
5. Set *Scale-out cooldown* to `60 seconds` and *Scale-in cooldown* to `300 seconds`, then save the policy. After each scale-out event, ECS waits 60 seconds for the new task to start and register with the target group. Scale-in waits five minutes to prevent fluctuating load from repeatedly adding and removing tasks.

After saving, the `cpu-70-target-tracking` policy monitors the service CPU within the range of `2` to `6` tasks.
