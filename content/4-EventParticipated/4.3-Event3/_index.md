## Key Highlights

### 1. Overview of Agentic AI

#### What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of **autonomously executing towards a goal** rather than simply responding to individual user commands. After receiving a goal, Agentic AI can independently plan, select tools, execute necessary steps, and evaluate results to complete tasks.

Key characteristics of Agentic AI:

- **Planning**: Breaking down complex tasks into specific action steps.
- **Decision-making**: Choosing appropriate actions based on context and goals.
- **Tool usage**: Calling APIs, searching for information, accessing databases, or using external services.
- **Self-execution**: Performing multiple consecutive steps with minimal human intervention.
- **Evaluation and adjustment**: Checking results after each step and modifying plans when necessary.

**Example:** A user requests _"Deploy application to AWS"_. Instead of just providing step-by-step instructions, Agentic AI can autonomously build the application, create a Docker image, push the image to a container registry, deploy to the cloud service, check system status, and report final results.

#### Levels of Autonomy

The workshop categorizes AI agents across an autonomy spectrum:

1. **Deterministic agents**: Operate according to fixed rules.  
   _Example:_ Automatically format source code or run CI workflows based on preset configurations.

2. **Reactive agents**: React to input without planning ahead.  
   _Example:_ GitHub Copilot generates code when a programmer enters a request.

3. **Goal-oriented agents**: Plan to achieve objectives.  
   _Example:_ AI receives a request to "Add payment functionality" then autonomously analyzes, writes code, creates APIs, and tests.

4. **Learning agents**: Learn from experience and improve.  
   _Example:_ AI remembers previous deployment errors to select more effective solutions in future attempts.

5. **Multi-agent systems**: Multiple agents coordinate with each other.  
   _Example:_ Coding Agent, Testing Agent, Security Agent, and DevOps Agent collaborate to complete a software project.

### 2. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

#### Overview

**Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** is an AWS service that supports building, deploying, and operating AI Agents in production environments. The service provides fully managed infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on agent logic rather than managing servers or infrastructure.

Notable capabilities of AgentCore:

- **Serverless Runtime**: Provides execution environment without infrastructure management.
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scales resources up or down based on traffic.
- **Integrated security**: Supports authentication, authorization, and integration with AWS security services.
- **AI Agent lifecycle management**: Supports development, testing, deployment, and operation in production environments.

#### Benefits

- **Reduced operational costs** through serverless architecture and AWS-managed infrastructure.
- **Increased scalability** to handle varying request volumes over time.
- **Ensured security** with built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Pay-per-use pricing**, only paying for actual resources or executions.
- **Shortened development time** through rapid deployment and testing processes.

---

### 3. Runtime Environment

#### Agent Execution Model

**Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime** provides a fully managed execution environment (runtime) for running AI Agents in production environments.

Key features:

- **Serverless Runtime**: Agents are launched on-demand, with no server management or provisioning required.
- **Firecracker MicroVM**: Each agent execution occurs in an isolated **Firecracker MicroVM**, enhancing security and ensuring consistent execution environment.
- **Auto-scaling**: Runtime automatically scales resources up or down based on request volume.
- **Session management**: Supports maintaining agent state throughout processing.

#### Memory Management

Runtime supports multiple memory management mechanisms to help AI Agents maintain context and perform multi-step tasks:

- **Session Memory**: Stores context within a session or conversation.
- **Long-term Memory**: Stores long-term information for reuse in future sessions.
- **Context Management**: Manages and optimizes the amount of context passed to language models.

#### Streaming Data Processing

AgentCore Runtime supports real-time responses to improve user experience:

- **Streaming Response**: Returns results incrementally as they're generated rather than waiting for complete processing.
- **Progress Updates**: Displays status or processing steps of the agent during execution.
- **Reduced perceived latency**: Users receive earlier responses for tasks with long processing times.

---

### 4. Identity & Security

#### Authentication & Authorization

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides authentication and authorization mechanisms to help AI Agents access resources securely.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Authenticates users or applications using tokens.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Manages identity and user authentication.
- **AWS IAM**: Controls AI Agent access to AWS resources following the **least privilege** principle.
- **Service-to-Service Authentication**: Secure authentication when AI Agents communicate with other services or APIs.

#### Tool Call Security

When AI Agents use external tools or APIs:

- Only granted access to necessary resources (**Least Privilege**).
- Each tool or API can have separate authorization policies applied.
- Activities are logged through **AWS CloudTrail** for auditing and monitoring.
- Data is encrypted during transmission using **HTTPS/TLS**.

#### Security Best Practices

For deploying AI Agents in production environments, AWS recommends:

- Deploy within **Amazon VPC** when network isolation is needed.
- Store API keys and sensitive information using **AWS Secrets Manager**.
- Apply **Least Privilege** principle for all IAM Roles and Policies.
- Monitor activities using **Amazon CloudWatch** and **AWS CloudTrail** for incident detection and audit support.

### 5. Gateway & Middleware

#### AgentCore Gateway

**Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway** is an intermediary layer that helps AI Agents connect with external tools, APIs, and services securely and consistently.

Key functions:

- **Request routing**: Routes AI Agent requests to the correct API or service.
- **API management**: Supports connections with various service types and protocols.
- **Authentication and authorization**: Controls access before AI Agents call tools.
- **Monitoring**: Records and tracks requests between AI Agents and external systems.

#### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

For critical tasks, AI Agents can request human approval before proceeding.

Examples:

- Approving financial transactions.
- Confirming bulk email or notification sends.
- Reviewing content before publication.

#### Middleware

Middleware helps AI Agents communicate effectively with other systems.

Common functions:

- **Data transformation** between AI Agents and APIs.
- **Caching** to reduce API calls and improve performance.
- **Retry and Error Handling** when external services encounter temporary errors.
- **Logging and Monitoring** to support oversight and troubleshooting.
